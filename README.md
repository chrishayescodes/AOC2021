# Advent of Code 2021 chrishayescodes

## Preface
Never done this before BUT, this year I will do it in WebAssembly.
I've never done WebAssembly NOR C NOR C++ so this is all new for
a crusty .Net dev.

Have been following Tsoding on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDaily

## Journal
### Day 1
Got set up with docker, wsl, and emscripten image on local machine.

File access in C and WebAssembly. You need to load the file to the WASM image. See: https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/files/packaging_files.html

C file access, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19123334/how-to-use-stdgetline-to-read-a-text-file-into-an-array-of-strings-in-c

### Day 2
Basically just did Day 1 and 2 together. Fairly simple problems.

### Day 3
Learned about linked lists in C. See:
